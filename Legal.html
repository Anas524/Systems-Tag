								<span style="font-size: xx-large;"> Introduction </span> </br>
								This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all visitors and users of the Systems Tag.chat hosted services and websites (collectively, the “Website” or “Websites”), which are offered by SYSTEMS TAG and/or any of its affiliates (“Systems Tag” or “we” or “us”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using any part of the Websites, you acknowledge you have been informed of and consent to our practices with regard to your personal information and data.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-size: xx-large;"> Data Protection </span> </br>
								Oversight of Data Security is handled by Systems Tag respective Data Protection Officers. Should you wish to make modifications, deletions, or additions to any personal data you believe to be captured by Systems Tag, or if you have any general security concerns, please contact us at privacy@trackingmaps.sa
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-size: xx-large;"> What Information Systems Tag Collects and Why </span>
								</br>
								<span style="font-weight: 600;"> Information from Website Visitors </span> </br>
								Like most website operators, Systems Tag collects basic non-personally-identifying information from Website visitors of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We collect this information to better understand how visitors use the Website, to improve our Websites and experience for visitors, and to monitor the security of the Websites. From time to time, Systems Tag may publicly release non-personally-identifying information collected from Website visitors in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.
								</br></br>
								Systems Tag also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from visitors. Systems Tag does not use such information to identify or track individual visitors, however. We collect this information to understand how visitors use the Websites, to improve performance and content, and to monitor the security of the Websites.
								</br></br>
								Systems Tag may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our Websites. For instance, Systems Tag may reveal how many downloads a particular version got using aggregated statistics that contain anonymous user information only.
								</br></br>
								<span style="font-weight: 600;"> Personally-Identifying Information </span> </br>
								Users of the Websites may choose to interact with Systems Tag in ways that provide us with their personally-identifying information. In some instances, a User ID is generated for form and url tracking, page views, page pings and usage counts in order to ascertain product performance and development. The amount and type of information that Systems Tag gathers depends on the nature of your interaction with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to share. For example, we ask visitors who use our live-chat widget to provide full name and email address. We will also collect the information you provide with us in connection with creating an account on the Website.
								</br> </br>
								If you report a security vulnerability to Systems Tag and request public acknowledgement, then we may publicly disclose the personal information you provided to us in connection with the report, including your name to fulfill your request for acknowledgement. In each case, Systems Tag collects such personally-identifiable information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s interaction with or request of Systems Tag . We will not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.
								</br></br>
								Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain Website-related activities or being able to access and use certain features and services. For details about what information is collected and with whom it is shared, please refer tracking technologies.
								</br></br>
								<span style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: 600;"> Information Systems Tag Does Not Collect </span> </br> </br>
								Systems Tag does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Systems Tag does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that users might store this kind of information in a Systems Tag instance by pushing it to us through our live-chat, our libraries or API. If you store any sensitive personal information on Systems Tag servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are located in the United States.
								</br></br>
								If you’re a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on the Website. Systems Tag does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our Website or content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will close the child’s account. Other countries may have different minimum age limits. If you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use Systems Tag .
								</br></br>
								<span style="font-size: xx-large;"> Basis for Processing Your Information </span> </br>
								<span style="font-weight: 600;"> Performance of a contract: </span>The use of your information may be necessary to perform the contract that you have with us. For example, if you use our Websites to purchase Systems Tag product subscriptions or services, contribute to a project, create a profile, post and comment through our Websites, or request information through our Websites, we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that contract or request.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-weight: 600;"> Legitimate interests: </span>We use your information for our legitimate interests, such as to provide you with the best content through our Websites and communications with users and the public, to improve and promote our products and services, and for administrative, security, fraud prevention and legal purposes.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-weight: 600;"> Consent: </span>We may rely on your consent to use your personal information for certain direct marketing purposes, such as sending you newsletter updates about Systems Tag products. You may withdraw your consent at any time through the unsubscribe feature provided with each marketing email or by contacting us at the addresses given at the end of this Privacy Policy.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-size: xx-large;"> How Systems Tag Uses and Protects Personally-Identifying Information
								</span> </br>
								<span style="font-weight: 600;"> Sharing Your Information </span> </br>
								Systems Tag only discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Systems Tag behalf or to provide services available on the Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
								Please note, email and IP addresses of users of a Systems Tag deployment may be shared with the respective users of that deployment.
								Systems Tag will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Systems Tag discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Systems Tag believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Systems Tag , third parties, or the public at large.
								Systems Tag takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
								Systems Tag at its sole discretion may make use of company logos where those companies are using the software that we provide. If you have concerns over the use of your logo, please email info@trackingmaps.sa.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-weight: 600;"> International Transfer of Information </span> </br>
								The Website is hosted in the United States and information we collect will be stored and processed on our servers in the United States. Our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that process information for us as described above may be located in the United States, India or in other countries outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the international transfer of your information by Systems Tag .
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-weight: 600;"> Systems Tag Communications with You </span> </br>
								If you are a registered user of the Websites and have supplied your email address, Systems Tag may occasionally send you an email to tell you about security, system information, new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Systems Tag and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. There’s an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you so you can stop receiving such emails at any time.
								</br>
								If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish your request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. We will not publish your personally-identifiable information in connection with your request.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-size: xx-large;"> Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Do Not Track
								</span> </br>
								<span style="font-weight: 600;"> Cookies </span>
								</br>
								A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Systems Tag uses cookies to identify and track visitors, their usage of the Websites, and their Website access preferences. Systems Tag visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers may set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Websites. Disabling browser cookies may cause certain features of Systems Tag websites to not function properly. Certain pages on the Website may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. These sites set their own cookies and we do not have access or control over these cookies. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-weight: 600;"> Tracking Technologies </span>
								</br>
								We may use third party tracking services, but we don’t use these services to track you individually or collect your personally identifiable-information. We may use these services to collect information about how the Website performs and how users navigate through and use the Website so we can monitor and improve our content and Website performance. Third party tracking services gather certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, timestamp, and similar data about your use of the Website. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-weight: 600;"> Do Not Track </span>
								</br>
								“Do Not Track” is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. Systems Tag does not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic tracking, which you may opt out of. Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser’s Do Not Track setting.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-size: xx-large;"> Global Privacy Practices
								</span> </br>
								Information we collect will be stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy but we understand that users from other countries may have different expectations and rights with regard to their privacy. For all Website visitors and users, no matter their country of location, we will:
								</br>
								<ul>• provide clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent when we do collect your personal information;</ul>
								<ul>• only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the purpose it is collected for, unless you choose to provide us more;</ul>
								<ul>• offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting your information that we have collected, with the exception of information you voluntarily provide that is necessary to retain as is for the integrity of our project code as described further below;</ul>
								<ul>• and provide Website users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement.</ul>
								If you are located in the European Union, you are entitled to the following rights with regard to your personal information and data:
								</br>
								<ul>• Right of access to your personal data, to know what information about you we hold.</ul>
								<ul>• Right to correct any incorrect or incomplete personal data about yourself that we hold.</ul>
								<ul>• Right to restrict/suspend our processing of your personal data.</ul>
								<ul>• Right to complain to a supervisory authority if you believe your privacy rights are being violated.</ul>
								Additional rights that may apply to you in certain instances:
								</br>
								<ul>• Right of data portability (if our processing is based on consent and automated means).</ul>
								<ul>• Right to withdraw consent at any time (if processing is based on consent).</ul>
								<ul>• Right to object to processing (if processing is based on legitimate interests).</ul>
								<ul>• Right to object to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes.</ul>
								<ul>• Right of erasure of your personal data from our system (“right to be forgotten”) if certain grounds are met.</ul>
								To exercise your privacy rights, you can email us at the address given below in the ‘Contacting Systems Tag About Your Privacy’ section of this Privacy Policy.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-size: xx-large;"> Data Retention and Deletion </span> </br>
								If you already have an account on the Websites, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by logging into your account and updating profile settings.
								</br>
								Systems Tag will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to perform our contractual obligations, provide you services through the Website, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our agreements.
								</br>
								Please note that due to the open source nature of our products, services, and community, we may retain limited personally-identifiable information indefinitely in order to ensure transactional integrity and nonrepudiation. For example, if you provide your information in connection with a blog post, GitHub issue or comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts. Also, as described in our Terms of Use, if you contribute to a Systems Tag project and provide your personal information in connection with that contribution, that information (including your name) will be embedded and publicly displayed with your contribution and we will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so would break the project code.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-size: xx-large;"> Contacting Systems Tag About Your Privacy </span> </br>
								If you have questions or concerns about the way we are handling your information, or would like to exercise your privacy rights, please email us with the subject line “Privacy Concern” at privacy@trackingmaps.sa. We will respond within 30 days of receiving your message at the latest but please note for promptest response, we recommend emailing us.
								</br> </br>
								<span style="font-size: xx-large;"> Privacy Policy Changes </span> </br>
								Although most changes are likely to be minor, Systems Tag may change its privacy policy from time to time, and in Systems Tag sole discretion. We may also provide notification to users who have provided us email addresses of material changes to this Privacy Policy through our Website. Systems Tag encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any minor changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
